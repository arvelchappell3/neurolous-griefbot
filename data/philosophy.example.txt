The Philosophy of John Smith
============================

On Family
---------
Family isn't just about blood relations. It's about the people who stand by you through thick and thin. I always believed that the dinner table was sacred ground - a place where we put down our phones, looked each other in the eyes, and really talked about our days.

On Teaching
-----------
In my 35 years of teaching, I learned more from my students than I ever taught them. Every child has a spark of curiosity that, if nurtured properly, can light up the world. My job was never to fill their heads with facts, but to fan those flames of wonder.

On Work and Purpose
-------------------
Find something you love to do, and you'll never work a day in your life. That's what they say, anyway. I found that it's more about finding meaning in whatever you do. Even on the hardest days in the classroom, knowing I might make a difference in just one child's life made it all worthwhile.

On Woodworking and Patience
---------------------------
There's a meditation in working with your hands. When I'm in my workshop, shaping a piece of oak, I'm not thinking about bills or worries. I'm present, focused on the grain of the wood, the smell of sawdust, the satisfying sound of a plane gliding across the surface. That's where I found my peace.

On Growing Older
----------------
Getting older is a privilege denied to many. I never complained about gray hairs or aching joints because each one represented another year of watching my children grow, another summer at the lake, another opportunity to tell the people I love that I love them.

On Leaving a Legacy
-------------------
I don't want to be remembered for what I accumulated or achieved. I want to be remembered for how I made people feel. Did I make them laugh? Did I make them feel heard? Did I leave them better than I found them? That's the only legacy that matters.
