Welcome to Your\
Personal Journey of Discovery\
The first step is Meditation.\
Learning to "listen" to that "voice within" you. Here is where the\
beginning of discovering who you are begins.\
You discover the "God/\
Goddess Consciousness" that is part of you.\
Relating to self is the basis upon which we relate to others.\
When you\
understand yourself you begin to understand where others may "be"\
at a given moment.\
Feelings about who you are and how you perceive\
yourself and others are basic to learning to cope with present reality.\
Strong feelings must be expressed. Because we choose not to express\
our feelings for the most part, this is the primary reason for discord in\
our personal and interpersonal relationships.\
There are specific reasons why people do the things they do. They\
may be aware of these reasons or not.\
Perceptions and concepts play\
important roles in helping us understand our behavior.\
Energy is just energy. It can be seen, felt, tasted, sensed and\
touched. It can be directed.\
It is just now being understood. We are\
energy. We have volition.\
We have responsibility to understand and\
use that energy wisely, consciously.\
There are fields of energy that\
surrounds us and are part of us.\
We will explore what they are and\
how to direct the energy.\
Your "Chakras" (energy centers located in\
and around your body), and "Aura" (energy field) are governed by\
"Natural Laws".\
You will be introduced to both.\
Other planes of existence have been long suspected by many. You\
will decide for yourself.\
Channeling is a form of mediumship. You\
will likely discover your own mediumship abilities.\
\
--- PAGE 9 ---\
\
We introduce you to "new information" and concepts yet to be widely\
known, and rich "food for thought."\
You create your reality; this is\
not a new concept.\
HOW you create your reality, as addressed here is\
brand new!\
You will be facilitated through this work which gives you\
enough to begin learning how to create your own reality.\
It is up to\
you to test the validity and correctness of this information and then\
apply it to your life.\
There are Four Aspects of who we are:\
\'95 SPIRIT\
We have a "God Consciousness which is Spirit.\
\'95 HEART\
We are Heart. We must have "love" for ourselves first, so\
we can give it to others.\
\'95 WILL\
Specifically "free will" the Creator's gift to us. We must\
express our Will without crossing another's Will or\
allowing our Will to be crossed.\
\'95 BODY\
Body, our form, is the physical manifestation, with which\
we express in this reality and experience all that can be seen.\
We must align and balance these Four Aspects in order to sustain our\
lives and really, to save ourselves.\
Misalignment is prevalent in our\
lives, as attested by the general content of newspapers and radio/TV\
newscasts.\
Negativity, strife, and "lovelessness" abounds.\
This discovery book introduces You to the real YOU.\
It facilitates discovering who YOU truly are.\
Step by step, it shows you how to\
align, integrate, and balance\
your Four Aspects:\
Spirit, Heart, Will, and Body.\

Discover the Who, What, and Why of You;\
Then Choose the Where and When\
\
--- PAGE 11 ---\
\
Who, What Why, Where. When 1\

Who, What, Why, Where, When\
How to discover "WHO" you are\
You have to be curious enough to form the question in the first place\
or desperate enough with the condition of your life to wonder what is\
going on and why?\
Why are you here, and where is here?\
You might ask in relationship to what? We would applaud you.\
Whether or not you have asked yourself these questions, you either\
have a very good idea of who you are, or not a clue and could care\
less.\
Maybe it is a burning question you have asked yourself more\
than once and have come up blank, or at best clouded as to the\
answer.\
Notice two very important things:\
1) you asked the question\
2) you are seeking an answer\
The answer is the discovery part.\
Let's set some ground rules so that you, the reader and we, the\
authors, can come to some understanding.\
The Who we are talking\
about is You. This You however, you have not met before.\
What you\
discover is the answer to "Who" you are.\
You may be reading this because you were intrigued by the title.\
Perhaps you are browsing now to see if this book is worth your time\
and money.\
Are you looking for some clue that will tell you that you\
have read a similar work, or heard this before?\
You should take the\
time to discern any work.\

Who, What, Why, Where, When.\
1\
Let me say now that you have not heard or read before,\
what you are now about to read.\
This experience is like no\
other you have had before.\
We assure you that once you\
have read this entire book, you will not think of yourself in\
the same way.\
You will not view othes in the same way. You\
will not see the world in the same way.\
You are in for a real\
"check" on your reality!\
Discover the WHY you are\
Do you remember when you struck out on your own? You left the\
"nest" of your up bringing.\
Think back to that day when you\
consciously knew that this was it; you were out on you own.\
How did\
it feel? No one to tell you what to do! You had finally gained your\
independence.\
If this hasn't happened for you, that's ok too. However, if it has, recall\
that day and what it represented to you.\
Whether it was a day of\
celebration or dread only matters to you.\
There you were, out on your own, independent and free.\
You're going\
to take the world by storm, a "take-charge" kind of person.\
How long did it take for your bubble to burst, a week, month, year, or\
few days?\
More importantly, have you regained your footing in the\
mean time?\
Are you still in charge or have you ever been?\
Are you\
independent, free, and have you taken the world by storm?\
Do you\
have everything in your life you could possibly want? Are you\
completely happy and content?\
If you are not, why not?\
Where do the circumstances of our lives come from? If you have\
asked "why me?", then you know what I mean.\
Notice when you ask\
yourself this question, it seems obvious that it has nothing to do with\
you, but it's someone or something else that's responsible for the\
"Why" of your circumstance(s).\
If your life seems to be an unending\
string of "circumstances" that are beyond your control, then don't stop\
reading this book!\
Have we got a surprise for you! It is all your\
creation!\

\
Who, What, Why, Where, When 1\
You just have to live long enough and you will begin to ask: "Why is\
this happening to me?"\
You have asked and this is the first step to\
finding out the "Why".\
Let us try to make sense of it all! You will discover that when you\
begin to seek answers to the most troubling and difficult questions\
you could possible ponder, your life will change.\
What, What, WHAT\
If you are wearing a frown on your face right now, then I have\
succeeded in peeking your ire, striking a nerve, pricking your curiosity\
to keep reading.\
What we are talking about now is the "What".\
"What" is it about your life that makes no sense sometimes?\
No matter how you try and "fix" whatever it is, it just doesn't\
seem to work\
"What" makes your life tick?\
"What" is the substance of your life?\
"What" is the significance of your life and the people you have\
in it?\
Here you are all grown up. You have people in your life you care\
about and who care about you.\
What have you got to show for it?\
Where is the bliss, joy, happiness, and struggle-free life you\
envisioned?\
Everywhere you look; newspaper, radio, TV, everyone's life seems to\
be all messed up.\
The people you work with all have similar problems\
to deal with;\
some not as bad and some a lot worse than yours.\
No matter what part of our lives we pause to look at, there is\
something there that just doesn't seem right.\
People just don't seem to\
care about one another "like they use to". So many people "solve"\
problems with violence.\
Don't people talk any more?\
There is more about the "What" that we are talking about here - the\
"What" of you.\
You contribute to all that you see around you.\
Whether "good, bad or indifferent", we all contribute individually and\
collectively.\

\
WHERE AND WHEN\
Who, What, Why, Where, When 1\
Now, are you beginning to understand how important Discovery is\
You have the answers! Answers?\
You ask, where do answers come\
from? They come from the way we make CHOICES, how we\
CHOOSE.\
We choose daily, hourly, and minute by minute on many\
things. We are even unconscious of choices we make.\
Yet we make\
them none the less. The lack of awareness about the choices we make\
is the difference in how and why we make certain choices.\
It is also\
the difference we make in how our lives appear to others and most\
importantly to ourselves.\
How else do we wind up "Where" we are most of the time?\
No\
matter "Where" you are in your life right now, you are there because\
you chose to be there!\
When you begin to understand how that can\
be, you can begin to make better choices.\
If you are in a situation or circumstance that is just intolerable, why do\
you stay?\
Whatever reasons you come up with, know that you are\
choosing one way or the other.\
Whatever the justification is, whether\
you are rationalizing or manipulating yourself, or someone else, you\
are doing it.\
If you say it is because of someone or something else\
other than you, again you are choosing.\
Even when you believe you\
have no choice, that too is a choice; you choose to believe what you\
believe.\
When you first picked up this book and began reading, for whatever\
reason, if you are still reading, that is for a reason too.\
Hear me when\
I say you are now beginning a journey of Discovery about you.\
That\
journey will lead you to answers about WHO, WHAT and WHY you\
are.\
You will know and understand that it is simply about the choices you\
make; they determine your life.\
When you understand, and most\
importantly, know without a doubt that your choices determine\
"When" you express as the "Who" that you are, it is because of\
"What" you have determined is best for all concerned.\
"Why"\
becomes crystal clear; it could not be otherwise. It is happening right\
in your "now" and that is "Where" ever you are.\

Choosing Choices\
If you are still with me, then let's begin. This book shares accounts of\
our experiences in life and our conclusion of how the balance of it will\
unfold.\
It is also a text and handbook. It shows you how you too, can\
make definitive changes in your life as you CHOOSE and make\
decisions.\
How do we choose?\
Where do choices come from?\
What do we choose?\
What do we choose with?\
Why do we make the choices we do?\
Why do we regret some of the choices we make and celebrate\
others?\
\'95 Why is it always after the fact that we have a clue?\
As we have already mentioned, most of us make choices\
unconsciously.\

\
It's a Matter of Choice\
2\
Did Your Parents Make You Do It?\
Like almost everyone, in the beginning we had most of our choices\
made for us.\
Our parents of course, made those first few major\
choices in our lives;\
where we lived and went to school, stuff like that,\
and what we had for dinner, even the brussel sprouts we never\
learned to like though now we choose to eat them or not.\
For most of us, when we finally were out on our own and had to make\
all the decisions concerning our lives, it was a rude awakening.\
There\
were times we wanted to run and make for home, or someplace\
where someone else would make decisions for us.\
There was one choice, that was made for most of us, as black people,\
early in our lives, for which we had no choice.\
We had to go to church\
every Sunday, from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.\
most Sundays: Sunday School,\
Morning Service, Afternoon Service and Evening Service.\
From about age seven or eight I went, no choice.\
Then one Sunday\
morning Mom asked, "Arvel do you want to go to church?"\
She\
knew from the expression on my face that I must not have heard her\
correctly and she repeated the question, I answered with an\
undeniable and resounding, "no Ma'me!".\
She smiled and left. I had\
the house to myself!\
- and a good case of the guilts, but I enjoyed that\
Sunday.\
She sensed and knew of my frustration with the "officers" of the\
church and their in-ability or unwillingness to answer a lot of my\
questions about the Bible and Spirituality.\
I thanked her dearly for\
seeing my frustration and allowing me to make other choices about\
"religion".\
I could never get anyone to explain certain scriptures. How did Cain\
and Abel take wives if there was only Adam and Eve?\
What\
happened from the time Christ turned 12 years old, left and then\
returned at age 30?\
And a few hundred other questions I had, and\
was promptly told not to ask.\
I share this to prompt you to ask yourself, how do you view and\
understand your notion about God / Creator?\
In a work such as this, it is appropriate to ask as a first step.\
Really\
this is a question about one's relationship to the Creator.\

\
It's a Matter of Choice 2\
Four Godly Notions\
As you ponder that for a moment, I am going to offer other notions of\
mine, discovered by me from the thousands of sources I have\
investigated on my path of self-discovery over a number of years.\
Notion 1:\
God / Creator is an evolving Creator. Creator is learning. Creator\
has made and may make mistakes;\
that's how S/He learns. Pause\
a minute and imagine Creator looking out over Creation and\
wanting to improve it.\
How else would S/He have known what to\
fix?\
Notion 2:\
Death was not intended to be in Creation. I pondered this one for a\
while.\
I'd ask in my prayers why is the world in such a state?\
Death and destruction seemed anti-God like to me. The Devil\
wasn't big enough, not with the view of God I held.\
Notion 3:\
Reincarnation was an attempt to correct death and it failed.\
No\
matter how many feelings of "deja vu" I had, for a long time, the\
concept of reincarnation just did not sit well with me, until I\
discovered this information, and suddenly reincarnation made\
sense.\
Notion 4:\
The Creator is composed of four aspects: Spirit, Heart, Will, and\
Body.\
As part of Creator, we also are four aspects. As we begin to\
understand, accept, and balance and align these aspects;\
disease,\
aging, and death will no longer have to be experienced.\
These are a few of the notions I will address. As notions they can be\
accepted or not by you.\
You have your own notions about truth and\
reality. By now you may have guessed that this journey of discovery\
upon which you have embarked with the reading of this book requires\
a certain degree of openness on your part.\
Please continue to be open.\
Learning does not stop for any of us until, and only when, we make\
the choice not to learn and grow.\
Whatever notions you hold about your relationship to Creator, please\
do not discard them, because any new information is just a notion\
until you have investigated and tested it.\
Understand that there will\
always be new information as long as you are seeking to know more.\

Thoughts Are Things\
Thoughts Are Things.\

Are You What They Think of You?\
How do you track your life's progress? How do you measure the\
successes of your life?\
Is it the car you drive, the home you own, the\
job you have, your career, or the people around you that help you feel\
fulfilled?\
Most of us allow what others think, to dictate how and what we do.\
We have this image to uphold, and uphold it we must, regardless of\
what it is, as opposed to what we think it is.\
Have you ever contemplated your life's purpose? What are you doing\
here, alive on the earth?\
What are you doing toward your life's\
purpose? No matter what you think that purpose is, ask yourself,\
"how does it feel"?\
And if you have not yet decided your life's\
purpose, why not?\
Look around you and describe what you see. Look, maybe for the first\
time, at who you are.\
If you are really brave, ask those close to you to\
describe you to you.\
Listen as this person speaks, take notes if you\
must, then compare what you thought they thought about you.\
Is there alignment with what you think about you?\

What is Your Greatest Desire?\
Putting all that aside for the moment, how would you express your\
greatest desire?\
What do you want for your life?\
What is your will?\
Where does desire come from?\
How do you decide what is best for you? Oh, you don't decide\
what is best for you? Why not?\
If you don't make your decisions based on what is best for you,\
then how do you make your decisions?\
Oh, you let others make decisions which they believe are best\
for you? How is it working? It's not;\
why not? Not your\
choices!\
Why didn't you choose for you? Is it easier to let someone else do it?\
Well, was it really?\
These are not unreasonable questions to ask of you, are they?\
And\
yes, we will find and have the answers momentarily.\
You have but first to seek, ask, and you shall find. The answers are\
inside you.\
How many times have you heard that? We are going to\
explore why that is so.\
You are going to discover, actually rediscover,\
you.\
What do you want? If you have what you want, what else do you\
want.\
If you do not have what you want, why not? If you do not\
know what you want, why not?\

\
Thoughts Are Things. 3\
Thoughts are things. Thoughts are real.\
Have you ever listened to your thoughts? In case you are wondering\
how to do that, let me tell you that you can both see and hear them.\
You do that through the words you use, those you speak and write.\
Especially those you write, for they usually take more time to\
formulate.\
We are always attempting to find just the right words.\
Thoughts and ideas are real. An idea becomes physically real when it\
becomes tangible.\
The inventor's prototype is the result of thoughts,\
trial and error, just before it becomes usable.\
Prior to that it was just a\
dream. We all dream.\
We all have ideas that work when we put more\
energy into them by testing them.\
We begin by speculating about\
"what if" and then we test it until we get it right.\
Thoughts and ideas\
are real.\
Look around you. Any and everything you see, whether man-made or\
natural, is an idea from man or Creator.\
Everything began as an idea.\
Ideas and thoughts do manifest.\
When spoken, thoughts gain energy\
and vibration and are more powerful.\
If you believe you CAN'T it's guaranteed you WON'T.\
Now how do you listen to your thoughts? By paying attention to the\
words you use. For example;\
how many times have you heard\
yourself use the word "can't"?\
How many times do you hear other\
people use the word "can't".\
When you use "can't" in whatever\
context, if you believe you "can't" you won't.\
If you listen carefully,\
when you use the word "can't", you sometimes mean something else.\
Again depending on the context, if you say "I can't", you sometimes\
mean that you don't want to.\
And it is just easier to say "I can't."\
Get your "BUT" out the way!\
"BUT" is another word we use which is misleading and can prevent us\
from realizing what our thoughts are reflecting to us.\
We use "but" so\
often we are hardly aware when it crops up.\
It usually occurs between\
two thoughts, and erases or diminishes the first part of the statement.\
For example: a boss might say to a person who is working for her,\
"Sally, I like your style of greeting people. It shows you are caring,\
but you are spending too much time away from the project so I'll have\
to dock you for the time away from your desk."\
What Sally, hears and\
remembers is that she not getting her work done.\
The compliment on\
how well she cares for people is lost!\
Or when we are talking about ourselves and we might hear ourselves\
say something like;\
"Gee, I would really like to go with you to the\
mall, but I have a report that I must finish tonight."\
On the surface, it\
makes sense and sounds reasonable. The person to whom you are\
speaking may hear and feel that you simply don't want to be bothered\
with them.\
The word "but" emphasizes what comes after and usually\
THE W BOOK 10 THE W BOOK\
\
--- PAGE 21 ---\
\
Thoughts Are Things. 3\
diminishes what was said before its use. We have a tendency to\
dismiss others by sometimes saying, "I know what you mean, but..."\
We completely negate and dismiss the other person and his or her\
comments.\
Stop "SHOULDING" on yourself!\
How many of you have ever been "should" on. It happens almost\
before we know it.\
It usually comes after we have (sometimes\
regretably) asked advice of someone.\
They inevitably say something\
like: you should have done this or that or the other, or you should not\
have done or said such 'n such.\
Usually the person doing the "should-\
ing" is speaking from their set of values, not yours.\
IF, if, if only!\
Another one: "IF". If only I had only known. "If I had been aware."\
I\
know I can if such and such happens. "IF" always provides the\
perfect excuse, especially when used in conjunction with then.\
If...\
then... and its done or not.\
Try not to TRY!\
Try this experiment between you and another person. You will need a\
pencil or pen.\
You as the experimenter say to the other person; " You\
have three chances to do what I am going to ask you to do".\
Place the\
pen between you two on the table. Then say: "I want you to try to\
pick up this pen."\
If they pick up the pen, take the pen from them and\
replace it on the table again and say to them, "You have two more\
chances to try and pick up the pen. Try to pick up the pen."\
If they\
pick up the pen again, take the pen from them and replace it on the\
table and say to them.\
"Last chance, try again." If they pick up the\
pen again, take the pen from them, replace it on the table.\
Say, "Let me demonstrate how to 'try' to pick up the pen."\
Simply\
pause with one hand extended over the pen, then say "I'm done." To\
try is not to do anything.\
You either do it or not. You of course, must\
give the preceding instruction exactly.\
If at anytime the person pauses\
and announces they are done, they've succeeded and passed the\
experiment.\
To "try" does not mean accomplish. When we say we\
will try, what do we mean?\
You can NEVER ALWAYS!\
Two words I have eliminated from my vocabulary are "always" and\
"never".\
There will never be a situation that will always come out as\
expected and there will always be a situation that will never come out\
as expected.\
They cancel each other.\

Alternative Replacement Words\
As you can see, thoughts as words can be very revealing.\
And what\
has my list of words revealed to you?\
Well first let's look at what\
happens when we replace the culprit words with alternatives:\
Words to Avoid\
Change to\
But\
And\
Inhibiting\
Can't\
Should\
Would\
Could\
If\
Ought to\
What if\
If...then\

Can, May\
Will, May\
May not\
No, May, May not\
Yes, May not\
I may\
Choose\
I have a choice\
Almost never\
Almost always\
Encouraging\
We can see that choice is encouraged as we think about how, and in\
what context some words are used, as opposed to others.\
What's so\
exciting about encouraging choice? It is how we choose what we\
want.\
The words we use, within a context, also show us how we allow\
others to choose for us and to what extent.\
Our words are the clues to\
what we think about "everything".\
Thoughts add a new or different\
twist to the rhyme about "sticks and stones may break my bones, but\
words will never hurt me!"\
Ah, quite the contrary. Words tell us how\
and what we are thinking in any moment.\
They also tell us what and\
how we think of ourselves. How do they do that?\
Problems or Challenges? It's Your Choice\
One day many years ago, I was contemplating my futre and taking\
inventory of my life.\
I realized that things were not really that bad but\
they sure could be a lot better.\
I felt I had met every problem I ever\
faced with all the resolve and determination I could muster and\
succeeded overcoming them most of the time.\
It seemed though, that\
with each victory over any "problem" I'd turn, woe and behold there\
would be another problem.\
No matter how well I was able to\
overcome those problems, my reward would be to face another\
problem.\
I'd discuss this phenomenon with friends and discovered that they too\
agreed that the same things seem to happen to them.\
There seemed to\
always be something to address. I then began to take a closer look at\
the problems in my life and noticed something.\
As I began to dig in\
and become more determined than ever to get better at solving my\
problems, I found that a lot of these "problems" were looking an awful\
lot alike.\
They seemed to blend. They would involve different people,\
THE W BOOK 12 THE W BOOK\
\
--- PAGE 23 ---\
\
Thoughts Are Things. 3\
it was just that the circumstances seemed similar. Some situations\
were very much alike as well.\
Though the issues would be different,\
they involved many of the same kinds of conflicts.\
I would then role up my sleeves and heave to, determined and\
resolved to conquer them.\
I'd win the battle, surface victorious and\
gear up to wrestle again with the next set of problems.\
I'd win most of\
the time and loose some of the time.\
I was getting tired of the same old\
stuff coming up in my life. They seemed to never go away.\
I'd have\
the same kind of arguments and conflicts with different people.\
As I began to notice this repetition it dawned on me, actually hit me\
like a ton of bricks, that it must be ME!\
Not that I was wrong perhaps,\
but it must have something to do with my attitude, outlook,, pproach\
to life.\
I read book after book about how we all are on a "path" and\
that there are lessons to be learned in our lives.\
And then it flashed. I\
had been dealing with "problems"; the word problem itself connotes\
struggle.\
In my mind, when I replaced the word "problem" with the\
word "challenge," omething miraculous happened. The problems\
diminished.\
No longer was I meeting problems head on, hoping to\
win.\
I was rising to meet the "challenge" of the experience and\
looking for the lesson to be learned.\
I could see a situation begin\
building around me and recognized "I had been there and done that,"\
and it was not necessary to repeat the experience!\
Words we use determine how we deal with situations in our lives.\
They give clues about who we are and our attitude about life.\
Our\
thoughts are how we decide to make choices.\
If our words reflect how we think, then where do the predominant\
ideals we hold come from?\
Why do we think the way we do? How\
did we get into this rut about believing we are making choices, when\
in fact, for the most part, we allow others to make choices for us?\
Think and Express\
What we think is very important. How we think is more important.\
That we think is most important.\
It is what distinguishes us from\
"other" species (as in relative, not superior), and most importantly,\
from each other.\
Expressing our thoughts is very important. It is how our "world\
view" is formed and most importantly, makes us adaptive as people.\
How much influence do our "beliefs" determine what we do?\
Where do beliefs come from?\
How do we know what we believe?\
What is the difference between what we believe and what we\
are told to believe?\
\'95 By whom are we told to believe what? Is it our teachers, clergy\
and parents?\
\'95 What do we do with the contradiction and hypocrisy we find in\
our beliefs?\
Experience supports and emphasizes what and why we believe.\

Thoughts Are Than 3\
Factors Forming Our Beliefs and Attitudes\
Geography:\
The first and most obvious is geography Where on the planet\
you were born.\
There are over five and a half billion of us on the\
planet.\
Why we believe differently is most influenced by\
geography.\
Environment:\
Most basic climate, tropical to frigid, determines dress and the\
importance and use of raw materials, including the kind of\
shelter and foods that are the most staple for us.\
\'95 Culture:\
Depending on the location and period of any given history of a\
people, you can examine and determine how, what, and who\
influenced the social, religious, political, and economic (haves\
and have-nots) bent of a culture Language is one of the most\
important factors that determine how ideas are held and passed\
on from generation to generation\
\'95 Heredity:\
Or biological and hereditary influences of an individual. Their\
intelligence (depending on who is doing the measuring and by\
what standards) and amount of education influences their\
beliefs.\
Generally, these are the major factors that influence how we think and\
what we believe.\
For example, observation shows that the major\
religions all have more things in common than different.\
They have a\
deity, a savior or avatar, a creation story, a moral about life and death,\
a revelation, and a holy book.\
And they all believe that their religion\
is the only one that is right!\
In my opinion, they are right-from their\
point of view\
Experiences, What Good are They?\
And so you might say we believe what we believe by the "accident" of\
our births.\
We continue to believe what we believe by what we\
experience.\
We then struggle with our beliefs as we think about them\
And how they may contradict themselves as we attempt to apply\
them.\
And how, in order for us to believe what we believe, we must\
deny others their beliefs in order to sustain ours.\
What a dilemuna!\
What do our "experiences" do for us?\
Are they just there?\
Do they just happen?\
Are they meant to teach?\
It depends on how you approach your life. If you see only problems\
you may miss the challenges of an experience as an opportunity to\
learn a valuable lesson, and then you are doomed to repeat them.\
You\
may feel that your beliefs are confirmed by what you experience.\

Thoughts Are Things.\
3\
Quite the contrary! You first believe, then experience and confirm\
what you believe.\
If you do not like your experience you can ask,\
"Now what"?\
Your experiences point to give you clues to what "your reality" might\
be.\
I intentionally said "your reality" as opposed to "reality". The\
only reality that matters is yours!\
It does not mean that there is not a\
"reality." You as an individual, define what "reality" is.\
You as an individual create your reality, just yours. Yes, it is relative\
to everyone's beliefs, and there can only be discussion and agreement,\
deliberate or otherwise.\
Let's take a closer look at how this happens.\
Your Thoughts Create Your Reality\
Thoughts are things. Ideas manifest. Ideas and thoughts become real\
as they manifest.\
We are a product of our beliefs and attitudes The\
experiences we have reflect those beliefs/attitudes, and reinforce\
them.\
Consciously or not, we create our reality by what we think.\
Relative to changes, we keep our beliefs and realities or replace them,\
relative to what we want.\
Our thoughts help form who we are.\
You are what you think. And to the extent you "buy" into what others\
think of you, you are that too.\
If there is agreement on your part, ok; if\
not, then you have something to work on.\
What you think is reflected\
by what you believe, along with where you were born, your culture,\
biological make up, society, religion, and other environmental factors.\

The experiences you have are yours.\
Whatever your perceptions are, they are uniquely yours because you\
are unique.\
That does not mean there is not agreement with others.\
Most of the time, we are more concerned as to how we do not agree,\
without knowing why.\
Our experiences reflect and reinforce our\
beliefs. We create our reality, consciously or not.\

Change is all around us. No matter how we might attempt to stall or\
forgo change, change happens.\
Change happens inside of us. We are\
growing. We grow older, we believe, everyday.\
We grow wiser, we\
believe, with age. We learn from mistakes or repeat them.\
There are\
changes beyond our control, we believe. There are simply things we\
can do nothing about, we believe, and our experiences prove it!\

Something else about change; it provides opportunity. There is a\
connection to the experience of something, and how it affects us.\
How\
do we know how it affects us? We know how it affects us by how it\
"feels".\
Notice how we are always more willing to repeat an\
experience if it felt good. We avoid experiences that are unpleasant.\

Thoughts Are Things. 3\
Feel Your Feelings\
For the most part we do not notice our feelings, or when we do\
acknowledge them, we discount them.\
They get in the way of the\
logic of the situation. Feelings are not considered as important as\
thoughts.\
Feelings are viewed as one of the major differences between sexes.\
For example, some believe that women are always emotional and\
therefore do not think well, especially under pressure.\
Therefore,\
women are not considered capable in some positions. "What! - a\
woman President? No way!", some will say.\
Stereotypes are based on\
beliefs reinforced by the "created experience or reality" and then\
espoused as "truth".\
This is all because we tend to ignore feelings.\
Example: how many of you have engaged in a conversation, and\
whatever the topic, stopped yourself from saying something you felt\
you might have, and just didn't.\
No matter what you might have said,\
it was prompted by what you felt about what you heard.\
You "bit\
your tongue" not to hurt feelings. You didn't say what you felt\
because you feared what others may have thought of you.\
Perhaps the price you paid for not saying what you felt was an upset\
stomach, or you were completely misunderstood, or the wrong\
assumption was made.\
At any rate you find your feelings escalating\
regarding the situation, and you feel totally ignored.\
Stuff Them and Suffer\
You suppressed your feelings. You did not say what you felt. Those\
suppressed feelings become Resentment at some point.\
Have you\
ever served on a committee? They are wonderful creatures.\
It's\
interesting to watch the dynamic of how committees evolve, then\
falter and expire without a whimper.\
Usually when any member of a committee:\
is not allowed to express freely\
is cut short\
is not taken seriously\
is intimidated into silence,\
is cowered into changing his mind, perhaps because he is\
perceived as too emotional and less logical, this causes the\
committee to falter.\
Consciously or not, this individual will not give his total commitment\
to the project. Let's call him Henry.\
Henry needs to express his\
feelings. He may even sabotage the project in order to have input to\
the "new" solution, and thus be given an opportunity to say what he\
originally intended.\
THE W BOOK\
17 THE W BOOK\
\
--- PAGE 28 ---\
\
Thoughts Are Things. 3\
Now, why would Henry do that? Perhaps because Henry is just a\
member and not the chairman of the committee, and feels he has more\
expertise, he may blame the chairman for not acknowledging his input\
as important.\
At the same time Henry may feel guilty for not sticking\
to his convictions and saying what he felt he needed to say.\
Depending on some specific history, by his perception, Henry may\
have felt that the chairman, (who, by the way is a woman; and might\
be more appropriately, referred to as chairperson) and it stir gender\
issues for Henry.\
Henry feels angry at her, his perception.\
Consequently, he reacts out of fear, and chooses not to "push" his\
position.\
What history could have precipitated such a response by Henry?\
We\
all make sense of our current experiences based on other experiences.\
Especially if this current experience is similar in circumstance or\
situation.\
We then have a tendency to react or choose similarly.\
Sometimes without thinking, out of habit.\
Then we wonder why\
outcomes never change, not realizing that we have done the same\
thing time and time again.\
Since Henry has not given voice before, he\
may believe that he really has no right to expect to be heard this time\
either.\
The chairperson may be thinking that Henry has never had\
anything to say before, and is going to go along anyway.\
She has\
judged and has her experiences to prove why her judgements are\
valid.\
Henry may even be aware that he is being judged, and judged\
unfairly. However he continues to not say anything.\
He continues to\
stuff his feelings. He imagines all the ramifications of what might\
happen if he says anything that he believes might jeopardize his job.\
Why risk "rocking the boat"; he knows that if he can just do whatever\
he is told, soon that promotion may be his.\
After all, he has seniority\
and knows more than all these "kids" they have been hiring lately.\
Henry also knows or believes that unless he does something that\
validates his worth (at least in the eyes of his boss) he might find\
himself on the street.\
That's what happen to Howard. And after all\
Howard had done well all those years.\
Henry is terrified the same\
thing could happen to him. In the deepest part of himself, Henry is\
also enraged.\
He may not be aware of the terror or rage that is buried\
inside him.\

envy\
\uc0\u9899 worry\
\'95 blame\
\'95 fear\
judgments\
rage\
\'95 shame\
\'95 anger\
\'95 terror\
Secondary feelings are pity, sorrow, malice and revenge. With a little\
thought and introspection, you can identify more.\
We are aware of the results of suppressed feelings. We see it\
everyday, every media account on radio, TV, newspaper, and\
magazine.\
Its called the "daily news".\
When we look behind the headlines we see the hurt feelings, whether\
victim or perpetrator; the violence is appalling.\
The right or wrong of\
it makes no sense until we question why, and seek answers.\
Henry is typical, and there are Henriettas too, suppressing their\
feelings.\
The work environment is easy to relate to, if you work.\
If\
not, just imagine any place where there are people.\
People are people. They all have feelings suppressed or not.\
People\
express who they are or not, aware of who they are or not.\
It looks\
like we have become what we are so used to seeing on the daily\
evening news.\
"We" are "They"\
Our society reflects what we have become. We have become\
complacent. We feel helpless to effect change.\
I want to emphasize\
how we view change. Who is this "we"?\
It is the same "they" we will\
hear ourselves blame for whatever predicament we find ourselves in:\
YOU.\
Each of us contributes to society. Individually we participate.\
Individually we allow. Individually we make choices that affect one\
another.\
Because we ignore our own feelings, we have a tendency to\
ignore the feelings of others.\
It has become the norm. We don't see\
how we can help and we do not see how we contribute to all that is\
around us.\
By pretending not to "see," and most importantly not to feel, we all\
participate a little at a time.\
We all play a part. We all have our part to\
do.\
We have our "part" to take responsibility for, or not.\

Fixing It!\
How do we fix anything? By rolling up your sleeves and digging in!\
The remedy begins with you.\
You are an individual. You are unique.\
You are your thoughts. You are what you think. You have feelings.\
Feelings you ignore. You are your feelings, your thoughts, and more.\
Changing It!\
Then how do we approach change? What is the difference between\
being pro-active or re-active about change?\
How much are we\
controlled by others? We are controlled by others to the degree that\
we allow it.\
We allow it by abdicating choice. When we, allow others\
to choose for us (which is a choice), instead of choosing for ourselves\
we are allowing others to control us.\
What do you really want and why?\
Why are you here (where ever "here" is)?\
What do you hope to accomplish, if anything?\
How do you know what you want?\
What do you think?\
What are your thoughts on anything?\
Your thoughts!!\
Why do you have the thoughts you do? Where did they come from?\
How did the circumstances of your life right now come to be?\
Who brought you to this place and space of your life?\
Who's fault is it, if you want to blame?\
Who's choice was it, if you want to take credit?\
The answer is the same, YOU! No one else. You choose, period. You\
choose consciously or unconsciously, period.\
To choose not to\
choose is a choice. Non-awareness is unconsciousness.\
Unawareness\
or not being aware, is a choice you make; you choose not to know.\
You choose to be unconscious.\
No one's fault but yours. You are\
where you are by choice.\
How and when do we choose? In the moment.\
Moment: a fraction of a second to eternity as you are giving\
attention with intent and purpose.\
THE W BOOK 20\
THE W BOOK\

\

The attention you give anything, is what you are thinking about.\
The\
intent you give those thoughts around that "thing" is what you want.\
The computer term "garbage in garbage out" (GIGO) applies to us\
also.\
The intention you have, going into a situation affects its\
outcome.\
If you do not know what you want, and choose not to chose,\
or allow others to choose for you, then the outcome reflects your\
experience.\
What Changes Would You Make?\
If you could change anything, what changes would you make? You\
change every moment, through and by your choices.\
Your thoughts\
change. Daily, you acquire new information and discard old\
information, and act accordingly. Consciously and otherwise.\
Your\
reality you create. Aware or not.\
Your awareness of your thoughts becomes clearer as you listen to your\
thoughts by listening to the words you use.\
As you take note of the\
number of times you hear yourself say "I can't", you now know that if\
you believe you can't, this guarantees that you won't.\
If you allow\
others to tell you, 'you can't', and you believe them, this guarantees\
you will not.\
If you catch yourself forming the word "can't", or even say it for that\
matter, know that you can "cancel" any "can't" thought and replace it\
with you can.\
For you can do anything you choose. "Where there's a\
will there's a way!"\

You are the product of your thoughts, beliefs, attitudes, experiences,\
and how you choose in light of change.\
The "change" you see is the\
result of your thoughts. Change means changing from within.\
Listening to your thoughts.\
Understanding that you are becoming,\
growing, and evolving every moment.\
Understand that you have to\
make your own choices, for if you don't, others will.\
What is the circumstance of your life right now?\
Are you experiencing and having everything that you could want?\
If not, why not?\
If you could change anything, what would it be?\
Oh yes, you do have everything you want!\
If we told you that you have everything in your life that you want,\
what would you say? It's true.\
Right now you have everything you\
want! Everything you want, not necessarily what you have asked for.\
You have created all that you have in your life right now.\
You created\
what you have by your thoughts, beliefs, and experiences. Change is\
inevitable.\
It's how you approach change and what it means to you\
that makes the difference.\
Your experiences are reflections of your\
reality.\
What is change and when does it happen? Why is it we generally only\
realize it needs attention after the fact?\
Do you actively seek change or\
are you one who waits until it happens around you and then react?\
What things in your life are you experiencing right now that are very\
pleasing and you want to maintain?\
What things in your life would\
you rather not have as part of your life experience?\
You are\
responsible for it all.\
The "how" and "why" of your experiences are as important as the\
"who" and "what".\
Your experience is the result of choices you have\
made.\
Every experience you have is the result of your making choices:\
Your choices lead to the circumstances of your life.\
Each circumstance contains situations that point to and contain\
issues with which you and others will have to contend.\
Events are the parameters around which our attention is\
focused.\
Events literally define the moment.\

Are you (or someone else) crossing your will?\
To what do we give our attention?\
Situations stem from circumstances. Our feelings help us distinguish\
one situation from the other. Feelings we usually deny.\
It is usually\
after the fact that we have to pause and ask why or what just\
happened?\
And then you wonder why things are the way they are?\
Your feelings around these moments offer clues as to whether or not\
your Will is being "crossed" (denied, blocked, thwarted, etc.).\
What\
kind of feelings? Feelings that surface usually after the fact, they eat at\
you or at least cause you to pause.\
These feelings are not as obvious as\
might otherwise be if you don't realize they are there.\
Resentment is one feeling that\
is typically overlooked or stuffed.\
In the past how often have you "bitten your tongue"?\
For whatever\
reason, you chose not to speak up when the opportunity arose, why?\
Now you feel that you should have, but much too late.\
You felt you\
should have said something instead of not saying anything.\
You later\
regretted not saying what you thought you might have.\
When people\
do this, it leads to "going along" and regretting or feeling resentful, to\
the point of sabotaging whatever was resentfully agreed to.\
Does life happen to you or is life something you make happen?\
Balance is what we lack in our lives.\
When we begin to realize that thoughts and especially feelings are\
vastly important to our decision-making process, it will finally be\
possible to find and maintain balance in our lives.\
More on balance a\
little later.\
Love is the Key\
A Love that has not yet been realized in Creation. Lovelessness\
prevails. Why?\
Because we have yet to learn to care enough about\
ourselves.\

You express who you are, whether aware of it or not\
You define who you are by the ideas and truths you hold dear.\
These\
ideas and truths become part of who you are. When you do not define\
yourself, others will define you.\
And to the extent you allow it, you\
live and believe their definition of you\
You must express. Do so without crossing another's Will and do not\
allow others to cross your Will.\
This simple rule supersedes those\
other rules that have become so distorted.\
I truly believed that the "Golden Rule" meant what it said.\
"Do unto\
others as you would have them do unto you."\
By consensus it has\
deteriorated into: "Do unto others before they do unto you", and "He\
who has the gold, rules."\
There is purpose and meaning to life, and you are Life's student.\
You\
are here to learn, to grow, to evolve, and to love. The world is in need\
of repair.\
Read any headline. The things humans do to one another\
and to the planet cannot continue much longer.\
Each of us has a part\
to play. Each of us contributes directly or indirectly to everything that\
happens around us.\
It is the direct involvement and ambivalence that\
we must address first.\
Just as we contribute to the lovelessness\
indirectly, directly we can have an impact on the world when we work\
to make better choices in our lives.\

Intent, Purpose, Balance. 4\
To express without crossing another's Will, and not allowing anyone\
to cross our own Will is not as simple or difficult as it sounds.\
It takes\
really looking at what you mean by Will and understanding what it\
means to cross another's Will.\
If you imagine there will be chaos and\
utter confusion if everyone expressed their Will, you'd be correct.\
Remember, I said you are not to allow anyone to cross your Will;\
then\
you might also imagine murder and mayhem. You would also be\
correct from your point of view.\
I have tested this rule and found that\
it works for me. I believe it will work for you.\
Metaphysical You\
The Philosophy of Metaphysics demands that the individual seeks and\
asks questions.\
It is the search for answers about the origin of all\
things.\
When you embark upon such a quest you soon learn that no\
matter what questions you ask, you will always find an answer, and\
that answer then allows you to ask the next question.\
You learn that\
in order to know, you must ask more and better questions.\
Whatever you think the answer might be, it works until you learn\
about alternatives and other people's points of view that allow you to\
form your own point of view.\
Metaphysics is a broad subject. It is as broad and varied as you might\
find people willing to offer an opinion.\
Questions asked and answers\
pursued vary greatly. You must assess and validate any answer to\
any question.\
It must make sense to you. The only limit is your\
degree of awareness, and that too is a conscious choice.\
It simply\
never ends, there will always be more.\

How to ask the "right" questions\
This is an individual journey. Simply ask the right question. The\
"right" question is the one that moves you forward, as opposed to the\
one that satisfies you permanently and does not prompt more\
questions.\
How do you know when you are asking the right questions, and more\
importantly finding the right answers?\
Look at your life! Look\
around you:\
What do you see?\
The people in your life: who are they to you and you to them?\
What are your relationships like?\
Are they to your liking?\
Are you satisfied, happy, unhappy, joyous, or otherwise?\
If so, why?\
What would you change?\
Now that you know you can have and do what you want, what\
next?\
We each form our reality based on our thoughts and beliefs reinforced\
by our experiences.\
Therefore, each of us, simply, has a point of view.\
More importantly, each of us is entitled to whatever that point of view\
might be.\
Your point of view is formed by what you think, believe,\
and experience. Until challenged, it may remain significantly\
unchanged.\
After all, who are you to attempt to "change" someone. All you have\
is your point of view.\
We each form our reality by what we think.\
When our points of view match or we agree, then to that degree does\
our view of reality agree.\
We have limited agreement and therefore it\
seems like the same reality.\
It is the same only as we agree it is,\
because we all have a different set of lenses through which we not\
only see the world, but "see" the world, we can see with more than\
our eyes.\
Who wins?\
There will always be at least two points of view expressed no matter\
what the question or the relationship between the questioners\
Depending on the seriousness of the question and degree of conflict,\
the outcome can be predicted.\
He who has the gold will win, or the\
first who willingly gives up his or her Will (aware or not), will lose.\

Which "you" are "you" with another?\
Imagine any aspect of your life in which you have had to deal with\
someone else;\
parents, spouse, significant other, children, a complete\
stranger, you were, and will always be the common denominator.\
Now this may seem obvious to you. Let me ask you:\
Which "you" are "you" when you are with any of those other\
people?\
Which mask do you wear when and with whom?\
Do you wear a mask at all? If you don't, do the other people?\
How do you know for sure if they are or are not wearing a\
mask or presenting a facade?\
And in relationships...\
Are you the same "you" in the beginning of that "new"\
relationship as you are when you break-up?\
Are you the same "you" after all these years with whom you're\
with now, as then?\
Are they the same?\
When do either of you decide you no longer need to "put your\
best foot forward"?\
Is it when you feel safe enough to be who you "really" are\
without Fear of being rejected?\
Or is it when you don't care if you are rejected, because you\
want "out"?\
Do you now have some idea of the great volume of misunderstanding\
and pain which has occurred between people who have never had a\
chance to express their feelings in relationships?\
How many people\
pretend? How many people do you know who are absolutely happy\
where they work and are absolutely happy in their intimate\
relationships?\
Probably very few!\
Fifty percent of people who marry, divorce in less than five years.\
What does this say of the 50% who are still married and don't want to\
be, but stick it out for whatever reason?\
Their marriage is not what\
they really want, and they stay for reasons not their own.\
Why do people work where they don't want as evidenced by their\
attitude and actions?\
Why do people stay in relationships they don't\
want as evidenced by their infidelity?\

Recognizing when your WILL is being crossed!\
When you suppress your feelings you are crossing your own Will\
When you allow other people to cross your Will, you usually feel in\
your gut that what was spoken or done does not feel "right" When\
you are used to suppressing and ignoring your own feelings, it is easy\
to allow others to suppress and ignore your feelings or cross your\
Will.\
Until you become aware of and acknowledge your own feelings\
about everything, you will continue to cross your Will and allow\
others to cross your Will.\
During a conversation, for example, when\
you recognize you're feeling resentful about what is being said or\
done, your Will is being crossed.\
When you deny your feelings, you feel guilt, blame, fear, anger, act\
out of habit, judge heavily (yours and others), and eventually suppress\
a lot of rage and terror.\
This is what imbalance looks like. I have\
spoken of Balance.\
Creator's Four Aspects\
Earlier we mentioned our view Creator. That All of Creation is part of\
Creator. That we are part of Creator.\
If this unseen force is Creator\
and is the Creator of Creation, then no-thing is left out of Creation\
Creator then, is All That Is.\
There are four aspects to Creator: Spirit, Heart, Will, and Body.\
In\
some holy books, man is said to have been made in the image of God.\
As part of Creator, All That Is, we too have these four aspects.\
Spirit:\
Consciousness. Notion of Creator, God, Goddess, All That Is,\
Thought, Mind\
Heart:\
Love is Creator's Gift. You are the embodiment of that Gift.\
You\
have to acknowledge and then accept the Creator's Gift of Love to\
you\
Will:\
Divine Will, the Creator's Gift, is not inconsistent with Free Will\
Desires, feelings, and emotions are Free Will.\
Body:\
Body is Manifested Reality. Your world, your reality, what you\
create and manifest.\

These four aspects must be balanced and aligned in the moment,\
moment to moment. As a result, outcomes are balanced.\
No matter\
what the circunstance, situation, or issue, you are in the middle of it.\
Your choice is your choice.\
Choose from a balanced place, a centered\
place, and choose for you.\
The outcome will be as you want, and\
everyone benefits.\
"Centered" we said. Thoughts and feelings must be acknowledged.\
Heart is your Balance Point.\
Unconditional Love (True Love) has\
never existed on the planet as intended.\
Unconditional Love (True\
Love) has not existed because of the predominance of imbalance. We\
have always denied our feelings.\
Resentment, envy, guilt, blame, fear,\
anger, habit, judgment, rage and terror have always been suppressed.\
There has been no acceptance for their expression.\
Learn How to Balance and Align\
Balanced choices occur in your heart. The first step towards this is to\
first love You.\
To love You, you must accept you. Only when you\
love yourself, can you give love to anyone else.\
To know and\
understand yourself allows you to understand others. To allow others\
their Will is to claim your Will.\
To express who and what you are\
without crossing another's Will (or allow your Will to be crossed) can\
only happen in Love.\
Make the choices you feel will be for your highest and best good.\
When you do so, it will be for everyone's best interest.\
Making\
chowes short of your highest good, means you are allowing someone\
else to choose for you.\
By nature they will make the choice best for\
them, not you.\
You are the only one that can do that.\

\
Intent, Purpose. Balance 4\
Choose in the moment. Each moment counts. When we attempt to\
correct past "wrongs" we learn that we can not undo or change the\
past.\
There is only now and tomorrow is not promised. To what do\
you give the most attention, yesterday or tomorrow?\
It is determined\
by the choices you make in the "now".\
Balance and alignment in the moment, is important as you are giving\
attention with intent and purpose.\
Moments have validity when they\
have intent and purpose, no matter the circumstance, situation, or\
issue.\
To have clear intent as you express, means to consider your\
thoughts and feelings around the issue, then lovingly come to the\
choice that is loving for you.\
You are obligated to you, for you, and by\
you because you love you.\
Responsibility means having, taking, and\
exercising your "ability to respond". Accountability means making\
your choices "count".\
The words we use are our reflected thoughts. When we learn to hear\
and listen to our thoughts we will learn to recognized when our Wills\
are being crossed.\
When you hear words such as should, ought and\
but; they signal denial;\
they signal that the Will is being crossed. Our\
choices lead to decisions and actions we take.\
They set the route and\
direction of the outcome.\
Remember that being still and doing nothing, can be an action and is\
sometimes appropriate, as long as there is a purpose.\
Action comes in\
many forms. Just know that you do what you do with a purpose in\
mind.\
"Balance and alignment" means to look at your life; if you\
conclude your life is simply imbalanced, how do you balance it and\
why?\
When you make the decision to live your life lovingly, it is the\
beginning. Do it moment to moment.\
Live each moment with the\
intent to align. Once attained, maintain the balance moment by\
moment.\
Each moment holds your attention on a circumstance. How\
does that moment feel? Feelings help define the moment.\
Your Will\
(Feelings) lets you know when and if your will is being crossed, by\
how you feel in that moment.\
Just as we are learning how to listen to\
our thoughts, we can, now begin to understand and feel our feelings.\

Vent (Move) Your Feelings as Needed\
If necessary move to a safe place, and vent. Remember that you are\

The objective is to release the\

yourself or anyone else.\
Allow the moment. Acknowledge the emotion and then release that\

How to stop making "Inappropriate cholces"\
Sometimes we have difficultly realizing how a situation came to be.\
We look around and ask how could this be happening to me?\
When\
you find yourself asking such questions, attempting to get a handle on\
the "why" of the situation, know that you are in part responsible.\
You\
made the choices that brought you to that moment.\
Especially the\
choices you gave to someone else to make for you. And now you get\
to choose again!\
To stop "jumping out the frying pan into the fire",\
examine your thoughts and feelings around the moment, then lovingly\
choose for your highest and best good.\

If there still is confusion, or if you make an inappropriate choice,\
that's ok! Why?\
Because you get to choose again! And again and\

Choose and accept full responsibility for your choices, remembering\
you get to choose again if you don't like the outcome.\
Make your\

How to stop making "inappropriate choices in your life? Assess\
where you are right now. Look at the situation and ask yourself:\
"What would a person have to believe to accept this\

This exercise gives you clues on how to change your life.\
If the answer\
to that question feels good, makes sense, and is loving, accept it.\
If the\
answer does not feel good or loving to you, make another choice!\
Do not deny your feelings. Feelings are here to help you choose\
appropriately.\
Choose in the moment, as you are giving attention\
with intent, loving intent. You must have love to give love.\

How to Meditate\
Meditation is how we make sense of our personal worlds. It helps us\
relate to ourselves.\
Meditation is the basis of Metaphysics. It is the\
"going inside" ourselves to find the answers to our questions.\
Meditation is ancient. Meditation is practiced throughout the world.\
It has many forms, active and passive.\
Common among those who\
meditate is a reverence toward oneself and a notion of "Creator or\
God"\
While related to prayer, meditation differs this way. Prayer is\
"speaking" to God.\
Meditation is when we "listen" Preparing to\
meditate involves several things: a time, place, and "cleared space"\
\'95 We recommend you set aside a time that is quiet, like early\
morning, between four and six, when the city is relatively quiet.\
This is like making a regular appointment with you.\
\'95 Choose a place that is readily available, comfortable and free of\
clutter.\
A comfortable chair, made of wood and straight backed.\
By "cleared space" we mean cleared and ready to use by you.\
We\
recommend that you sit, feet flat, palms down in front of you\
Begin to clear your space with a prayer that clarifies your intent to\
connect with energy that is only for your highest and best good\
and that you be kept safe trom any harm or danger.\

\'95 Relax and begin to breathe slow deep breaths. As you breathe\
relax each muscle group, head to toe or vice versa.\
Once\
completely relaxed begin breathing in rhythm by counting: inhale\
for a count of two, exhale for a count of four;\
then when\
comfortable, inhale for a count of three and exhale in six counts.\
Soon you won't notice your breathing.\
Quiet your thoughts and\
begin to listen, feel or sense what you are receiving.\
In the beginning the greatest benefit may simply be that you are taking\
time out for you to relax.\
Read and study information on meditation\
or join a meditation class.\
These will all help you to find the\
meditation that is correct for you at this time.\
As you keep your\
appointment with you and ask for the help you need, it will come.\
You will begin to feel differently as you regularly sit in meditation.\
Changes will occur in your body.\
After meditation, you will\
increasingly experience a flow of energy and a feeling that you're\
being energized through the balance of your day.\
We are energy. Matter is made of molecules. The spaces between\
molecules are proportional to the spaces between the stars in the sky.\
There are four states of matter: liquid, gas, solid and energy.\
Energy\
fields are made of positive and negative charges, both electric and\
magnetic.\
Medicine too, is always discovering new and exciting phenomena as it\
probes and searches for answers to the perplexing intricacies of how\
the body works.\
Doctors and scientists are learning the connection\
between mind and body.\
In your study of Metaphysics you will be introduced to a concept of\
energy regarding the body.\
The Sanskrit word "Chakra", means\
"circle of energy, or wheel of energy".\
There are circles of energy or\
Chakras" in and around all bodies. You will have to explore and test\
this hypothesis for yourself and we will simply introduce you to the\
concept.\
Through meditation, we have learned that there are twelve\
major chakras. There are also twelve senses.\
We plan to\
discuss this information in depth in Book II.\
We are still\
receiving information on the connection between the\
senses to the chakras.\

We are familiar with seven major Chakras or energy fields in the\
human body.\
The First Chakra\
is located in the tail bone or coccyx area, at the base of the spine.\
It\
resonates to the musical note of 'C'. It is red. It is responsible for the\
flight or fight syndrome.\
In emergency situations it prepares one to\
put up a good fight or run away.\
The Second Chakra\
is located near the genitalia area. It resonates to the musical note "D".\
It is orange.\
It is the creative and sexuality center. It is directly\
related to sexuality and our creative abilities.\
The Third Chakra\
is located in the solar plexus. It is the emotional feeling center. It\
resonates to the musical note of "E".\
It is yellow. It lets you know\
when your Will is crossed.\
It gives you that gut level feeling that\
something doesn't feel right or lets you know through feeling, that all\
is well.\

From unconditional love it expresses.\
The Fifth Chakra\
is located at the throat. It is the communication center. It resonates to\
the musical tone of 'G'.\
It is light blue. When this Chakra is operating\
at it's maximum, you communicate easily, not only to yourself, but to\
others.\
The Sixth Chakra\
is located in the forehead or brow, and is called the Third Eye. It is\
indigo.\
From this Chakra clairvoyance emerges. One starts to see\

As you grow comfortable in your meditation, you ask for information\
on the Chakras and see what response you get.\
You may ask about\
anything you desire answers or insight on.\
It is paramount to\
understand that it is YOUR answer that matters most.\
You learn that\
the answer to any question you ask simply leads you to ask another\
question.\
No matter what you think you know, there is more to know.\
The more you know, the more you know you don't know.\
Whenever you encounter new or different concepts or information,\
exercise discernment. Ask and seek answers to your questions.\
Move\
and grow at your pace. Keep whatever strikes you as appropriate and\
right for you, and shelve the rest, knowing that later, it may make\
sense.\
Yes, your thoughts, beliefs, and experiences affect how you view\
change. You are what you think.\
There is a connection between you\
and your notion of "God".\
We have given you our perspective of\
Creator, S/He is four aspects: Spirit. Heart, Will, and Body.\

Understanding Polarity\
Polarity, duality, and paradox are the stuff composing our lives.\
We\
often find ourselves in the middle of everything, not knowing which\
way to turn.\
We have relationships that are wonderful in the\
beginning, only to fall prey to confusion arising over differences of\
opinion, or simply unwillingness to admit the other person just may\
be right (though you realize you are right too).\
And that's when\
communication breaks down.\
Polarity is, simply, that view points have a range. We generally speak\
along a line of thought, and polarize along that line.\
Warm, as in\
temperature, is somewhere between hot and cold. Gray, the color, is\
somewhere between black and white.\
Likewise, our opinions fall\
somewhere between the two extremes of opposite viewpoint, as in a\
debate or argument.\
You are entitled to your own opinion as much as\
others are entitled to theirs, and you are both "right" from your\
respective "points of view".\
Without clear intent, recognizing this as\
true for you may be difficult. Polarized viewpoints divide us.\
And\
because neither side can "see" the other's viewpoint, they seldom\
communicate and therefore seldom resolve their differences.\
The Spirit and Will aspect of us are polarized. The Spirit Aspect\
thinks, the Will Aspect feels.\
Both, Spirit and Will have a point of\
view around issues.\
Because both are "right", neither wants to give\
in. Spirit usually wins any disagreement by overriding and\
suppressing the Will.\
This has become the norm.\
As thinking and caring people, have you ever wondered what keeps\
people apart? Why do people kill one another?\
Why are we so violent\
and separated along silly concepts such as politics, social class,\
education, religion, race, language, geography, and gender?\
Why do\
we emphasize differences and hardly notice similarities?\
Right and wrong, black and white, positive and negative are just\
different ends of the same pole.\
The balance is in the middle\
We are part of Creation. Bibles and other holy books, say we are made\
in the image of "God".\
Remember, we are four aspects: Spirit, Heart,\
Will and Body. We are energy expressing in Creation.\
We have Free\
Will, that is not inconsistent with the Creator's Divine Will.\
We have\
been given the gift of Love by our presence of Body and Mind and we\
must honestly accept them\

The Chakras must be felt, seen, or known to become real for you.\
As\
you meditate and quiet the mind chatter, ask for insight. Listen to\
what you are given. Test it.\
As you gain understanding, you will then\
know. The benefit of this becomes clear as you express who you are\
and use this information\
As you begin to understand the attributes of each Chakra and their\
relationship to one another and to you, you will begin to understand\
balance and alignment.\
As you come into balance, you understand imbalance more clearly.\
As we ponder why things are the way they are, and more importantly\
our role in it, we see that we need to ask better questions and pay\
closer attention to the information we're given\
With Heart's help, we receive clues on how to heal the imbalance and\
separation between Spirit and Will within us.\
Simple "polarization" is\
the cause. Understanding this polarization helps us understand\
ourselves and others.\

We'd like to share the evolution of a meditation affirmation As We\
were contemplating balance and alignment and its connection to He\
Chakra System, we considered the imbalance abundantly observable\
in the world around us.\
The media continually displays this. Almost\
any media account via radio.\
TV, or newspaper displays that people\
can't seem to get along\
When we ponder our roles and begin to search, we then begin to make\
sense of our reality.\
When we think of balance, perhaps we see a set of scales, with each\
side balanced or even.\
Of the seven Chakras, the 4th Chakra (Heart)\
rests in the middle.\
Heart is the 4th Chakra whether you start from\
the top or the bottom.\
When you are balanced, Love equals life.\
Chakras balance in Heart. The 7th Chakra and the 1st Chakra. The\
6th Chakra and the 2nd Chakra.\
The 5th Chakra and the 3rd Chakra\
should balance.\
A balanced life is one of Love. A balanced Creation is one of Love.\
The attributes of the Chakras correspond to the Four Aspects of\
ourselves and Creator. We are polarized and therefore imbalanced.\
As our understanding increases we can address the imbalance in\
ourselves and Creation\
When the "lower" Chakras are paired with the "higher" Chakras the\
numbers of their position add up to Eight.\

How to Balance and Align Yourself by Aligning Your Chakras\
As you become familiar and comfortable with these concepts consider\
beginning everyday with the following simple, yet powerful\
meditation.\

What is the quality of your life right now?\
Are you happy, healthy, whole and complete? Do you have\
everything you want in your life for yourself and those you love?\
The\
emphasis is "everything!!" If the answer is anything but a loud and\
vibrant YES!, then we are on the right track.\
You CAN have\
everything you desire, and be everything you want to be, literally,\
completely and right now!\
You are Spirit. You are part of All That Is. You must decide for\
yourself the validity of this.\
As Spirit, you continue even after\
"death". The soul that is you is much older than you realize.\
You\
have lived many lifetimes. You may someday "re-member", or it\
simply may not be necessary for you to recollect other lifetimes.\
However if you do desire to remember, and discover past/present\
patterns, etc., you are well on your way to significant healing.\
If you have discovered your guides, spirit teachers, guardian angels,\
you are well on your way to healing.\
Each of us must do our part in\
healing ourselves.\
This means exploring and rediscovering Who,\
What, and Why you are.\
Then doing what you do, whenever and\
wherever you are... Balanced and Aligned in love... from your\
understanding of that place of centeredness.\
You must express\
without crossing another's Will, and do not allow another to cross\
your Will.\
Understand you do not need to take anyone's power, or\
allow them to take yours.\
Expressing our Will and choosing from\
Heart will heal each of us.\

Death was not intended in Creation.\
Death was a misunderstanding. Reincarnation was an attempt to\
"correct" death that has not worked.\
We are still denying who, what\
and why we are.\
Deeper knowledge is now available for those who\
are looking and willing to examine it.\
Introspection provides further\
insight to properly assess truth.\
Ultimate health is everlasting life.\
We age, are dis-eased, and die because we have not fully understood\
enough about life, until now.\
We know there must be something\
better. The life most of us lead is not working.\
We know it is not\
working and we desire to know why it isn't. We know the answers\
exist somewhere.\
We need to search for them both outside ourselves\
and inside as well. How? The outside reflects the inside.\
What you\
see happening in your life, reflects what is happening inside of you,\
relative to where you are right now.\
Dis-ease and at-ease are relative.\
You can have whatever you want.\
In fact, you do have exactly what you want right now.\
How's that? You created the reality you have now, through your\
thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes.\
These reflect your degree of denial\
through all the circumstances of your life. Each situation helps you to\
choose.\
You know that you can cross your own Will. You often do.\
You simply must be aware you are doing this, and decide whether to\
continue.\
It is your choice to continue to deny you.\
Is your Will being crossed?\
Are you crossing another's Will.\
What are you feeling?\
What are you thinking?\
What might you do and why?\
To deny is to contribute to dis-ease. How do you choose without\
denying? Imbalance is dis-ease.\
To know balance is to recognize and\
know imbalance. Dis-ease leads to aging and death.\
You are energy. Thoughts are energy. Feelings are energy. Love is\
energy.\
Among these things, we know what imbalance looks like. We\
see it in the mirror.\
We feel it in the morning when we awaken. And\
after a hard day's work or whatever, we know it when we lay down at\
night.\
We see it on TV and in other media. The news is bad most of\
the time.\
All of this imbalance reflects the dis-ease of society. We are\
society.\
We are diseased and we all contribute until we decide\
otherwise.\
The choices we make ultimately lead and contribute to the\
quality of life we enjoy or wish we did.\

Until we know better, we choose from a state of polarized energy\
habitually. Why?\
Because we do not really know or appreciate the\
feeling/emotional aspect of who we are.\
We do not give this part of\
ourselves the attention it deserves.\
We are suspicious of our feelings\
and tend to ignore them.\
For they seem to offer little when we need to\
make "big and important" decisions.\
Now that you have been given certain notions, lest them. All your\
feelings are valid and must be considered.\
We must consider all\
aspects of us when we make choices.\
No matter what the\
circumstances, situation, or issues, it all boils down to choices.\
When\
we consider all aspects of us before making a choice, the outcome or\
results will be more balanced.\
Knowing and understanding this\
principle allows you to help you and those with whom you\

People are usually polarized around most issues.\
In their minds there is only one right answer or solution, theirs.\
There\
are no gray areas, only black or white. For those who allow "gray "g\
areas", the paradox can be crushing. We recognize there are points to\
be made by both sides of the issue. Both are "right" from their\
respective points of view. By definition, polarity is the opposite\
extreme ends of the same thing. Unless it is recognized and\
acknowledged, little can be accomplished as far as solutions are\
concerned Communication usually breaks down or is unlikely to\
Occur.\
We see this phenomenon happening around us daily We see people\
arguing to no avail because neither hears the other, let alone are\
interested in settling the issue.\
At the very least, communication just\
breaks off\

Compromise, consensus, and conformity are the usual remedies to\
conflict.\
They only work if there is agreement by all concerned, which\
is not usually the case.\
Conflict happens inside us and are reflected outside us. Real physical\
maladies can result.\
High blood pressure and heart conditions are the\
most obvious.\
Your thinking usually conflicts with your feelings,\
often with no reasonable remedy in sight.\
Even when we\
"compromise" with ourselves, we usually live to regret it sooner or\
later.\
Our Aspects span multiple dimensions\
We are flesh, bone, and blood. We are essence: vibratory energy,\
electric, magnetic, and electromagnetic, including that not yet\
discovered.\
Science knows there is an energy field around all living\
things, an aura.\
Many of us sense, feel, or even see this energy.\
Spirit\
Heart\
Will, Body! and whatever we have yet to\
discover is the "stuff" of which we are made.\
These aspects of us\
and Creator are just that, aspects.\
All That Is, is One, and we are One\
with All That Is. Aspects are relevant.\
As we understand them, we\
will better understand who and what we are. As energy and spirits\
manifested, we express.\
We choose, decide, and experience life. Some\
of us have more of one aspect working for us than another.\
As we\
discern and recognize this condition first in ourselves, we are able to\
recognize it in others.\
The more you are able to recognize your own\
imbalance, with a desire to restore your balance, the more aware you\
are of the moment.\
When you make a choice, you choose generally polarized around an\
issue, based on your thoughts or feelings about it.\
When you are in a\
conflict with another, the conflict evolves around yours or the other's\
strong opinion/feelings.\
People are generally in two major categories: they are either "Will-\
Polarized" or "Spirit-Polarized". Which are you?\
By recognizing your\
polarity you are better prepared to find solutions to any dilemma.\
Why?\
Because you are more knowledgeable about the dynamic of\
who and what you are.\

Polarization exists when two expressed\
views are at opposite ends of the same thing.\
Hot/Cold, Positive/Negative respective viewpoints of a situation are\
no different. Two or more people usually see the same thing\
differently.\
When you recognize polarization for what it is, you then\
know that in order to establish balance, you need to consider the\
"other end" of the viewpoint.\
Thoughts and feelings are polarized. Thoughts are electric energy;\
feelings are magnetic. We feel or think about everything.\
We are\
usually in conflict over which to listen, to our thoughts or feelings\
around an issue.\
Are You Spirit-Polarized?\
Thought/thinking have to do with logic, cost, risk, sense of "it" as it\
refers to an issue.\
If you are in your head most of the time (thinking)\
and thinking predominates how you choose, then you are generally\
"spirit polarized."\
Your choices then will be skewed toward Spirit,\
imbalanced.\

Don't be misled by these generalizations about polarized aspects. At\
some point in our lives we all indulge in one or more of these\
polarized states, unknowingly.\
Now that you have some references\
and notions, regarding this, the choices you have made up to now will\
have greater significance.\
Perhaps it's clearer to see that right now, the\
"who", "what" and "why" you are;\
equal the cumulative results of all\
of your choices.\
Your Goal: Be Balanced, Aligned, and Centered!\
"X" marks the spot; you are "here" and "now." What are you going to\
do next?\
Let's suppose WE make one choice a minute, while awake on\
average 16 hours each day.\
Then 60 x 16 = 960 choices made every 16\
hours (assuming you get eight hours sleep) each day.\
Now we\
certainly make more than one choice each minute, so, wouldn't you\
want to make more balanced choices?\
If you knew that the outcome\
of balanced choices would be closer to creating a reality you "truly"\
wanted, wouldn't that be even better?\

Balanced Choice, Balanced Outcome\
So you think you're really doing your own choosing?\
Because of our conditioning, we allow others to influence the degree to\
which we make choices.\
We do this by playing roles we assume\
others expect us to play. In so doing, we deny ourselves.\
If we are not\
aware that we are playing roles, are we allowing manipulation by\
others, or are we rationalizing our decisions after making them?\
This\
is tested each time our feelings give us the clue whether or not our\
Wills have been crossed.\
Resentments, regrets, guilts, blames, fears,\
angers, etc, are clues which indicate our Wills have been crossed.\
The\
words we use also reflect this. Can'ts, buts, shoulds, and oughts, etc.,\
give us clues that we are denying our Wills.\
We have shown you how\
to balance and align. We have talked about the importance of\
listening to your thoughts and feeling your emotions.\
You can change\
what you do not like about your reality.\
When you make balanced\
choices, the outcomes will be balanced.\
The key to making this knowledge work for\
you is the degree of honesty you have with you.\
Games involving "manipulation and rationalization" must be\
recognized. It can be difficult to know ourselves when we are fooling\
ourselves.\
When you have experienced life enough; and know when\
the experience is not what you want, then we begin asking questions\
and looking for reasons things are the way they are.\
You are the only\
person who can know what you know and how you feel.\
You\
however, must be honest with you. When you continue to ignore your\
feelings and say anything, whether you mean it or not, you are fooling\
yourself.\
More than likely, others will see through you. They know\
that most of the time you do not mean what you say.\
They know you\
are not sure that you know what you know. They see through your\
masks.\
You change often, moving from one facade to another, on a\
whim. They have little or no trust in you.\

When you decide to embark seriously upon this path of personal\

And be willing to forgive you. You are\
the only one who can do that, honestly.\

Let's look at balance and alignment\
The concepts of Spirit and Will are polarized and rest on either side of\
Heart. Love is where balance occurs.\
As we choose around any\
situation or issue we must consider all Four Aspects of who we are.\
Body is how choices are carried out, and it reflects our view of reality's\
outcomes.\
As you consider the thoughts you have around an issue, listen to your\
thoughts and concurrently feel your feelings Begin to balance around\
the issue by thinking about your feelings and feeling your thoughts.\
You do that by moving through Heart as you decide what would be\
best for you.\
You might think that it would lead to complete chaos\
and anarchy if everyone exercised their own Will, my question is what\
do we have now?\
Remember that you are also obliged not to cross\
another's Will or allow anyone to cross yours.\
As you learn more about balance and alignment and aspire to live that\
way, you will learn that you increasingly make more balanced, loving\
decisions, and everyone benefits.\
As you interact with others, do not\
allow them to give away their power to you.\
Show them how they\
must own their choices, as you do, moment to moment.\
As you give attention to your thoughts and feelings, balancing them\
through Heart, and choosing accordingly, you contribute to your\
healing and the healing of Creation.\

You will learn to distinguish between your denials and the denials of\
others. As you heal, you help others heal.\
As you apply what is being\
given here, and come to your own process, you grow in\
understanding and appreciation of your part in Creation.\
Your Body is a Living Miracle\
We have shown you the connection to balance and how it relates to\
the Chakra System.\
There is also a connection to the physical body\
systems; the Metaphysical and Physiological Connection.\
Physiologically, we are a miracle. There is more that we don't know\
about the human body than what we do know.\
In our quest to\
discover who we are and why we are here, we ask many questions\
and are led to many answers that seem to just lead to more questions.\
The Healing arts and ancient esoteric teachings facilitate\
understanding and appreciation of ourselves.\
The "stuff" of which we are made is more than we may have ever\
imagined-and-it is exactly as we have imagined.\
There is a macro\
cosmology and a micro cosmology. We are connected to both. "It" is\
all the same!\
The finite and the infinite is in each of us.\
You determine\
what and how much of it you choose to investigate.\
Biology gives us some understanding of how we are put together.\
The\
"body" is composed of many systems: the muscular/skeletal,\
nervous, respiratory, cardiac, digestive, reproductive, endocrine and\
excretory, etc.\
These major systems miraculously work together to sustain our lives.\
We have learned how to use herbs and medications to prolong life,\
combat disease, and heal injuries.\
We have learned how life-style has.\
an affect on our general health.\
The healing arts have a positive effect\
on battling disease, illness, or injury.\
As individuals, we have the\
greatest involvement in both, the condition of our health and our\
susceptibility to disease.\

The Chakra System correlate to the major Body systems and its\
functions. This helps us better understand how we "work."\
\
There is a connection to balance and imbalance, dis-ease (as we\
have given it context) and function and dysfunctions in the body\
and mind.\
We have associated Chakra and Organ/Function. The attributes of\
each Chakra is reflected in the function of the corresponding part\
of the body and its functions.\
Mysteries of how the body truly works will likely baffle us for\
quite some time.\
We are certain that in time, the body will reveal\
answers to some of our most troublesome questions.\
This happens\
in ways that will surprise us as we become more familiar and\
comfortable with how the body "speaks" to us.\

Catch a "warm" or a "cold", it's your CHOICE\
The DNA holds secrets we have yet to unravel. Cells are the building\
blocks of the organs.\
Tissues are formed from cells that carry out\
specific functions.\
We believe cells are intelligent and we can\
communicate with them directly.\
Not only that, but cells attempt to\
communicate with us directly.\
Where might this line of questioning and reasoning take us?\
Why are\
we so fervent, in our search for cures to disease? What does even\
posing this question imply?\
We desire to live healthier, don't we?\
Why? Because life without health is often not worth living.\
Health is\
relative isn't it?\
Because ill health exists, then so does healing. Healing implies cures\
for all ills.\
Would it then follow that if we knew where ills came from,\
therein might lie clues as to their cures?\
What if we could prevent all\
disease? What do illness and diseases have in common?\
Is there\
something we can find that gives us some indication as to how and\
why we are sometimes ill.\
Germs, bacteria, virus, injury and accidents\
are blamed as the cause of ill health.\
Why is it that some well known pathogens only affect some of us, and\
that not all known cures cure all of us?\
We are all affected by some\
malady at some point in our lives, because we are in and a part of the\
ecosystem of the planet.\
We affect and are affected by other things;\
plant, water, animal life and their ecosystem as we currently\
understand them.\
The more we seem to understand, the more we\
understand that we don't know nearly enough.\
We all get opportunities to experience "the common cold". Why don't\
we have a cure?\
When my daughter was very young she would come\
down with the sniffles, and as I would hold and comfort her, she'd\
start to give me reasons how she might have "caught cold".\
Then I\
would ask her, "now why would you do that?"\
She would then give\
me an incredulous look which said, "how could you ask such a silly\
question?"\
Then she would smile, cuddle closer, and take her\
medicine.\
We know that most medicines for colds don't work, or at least not fast\
enough.\
The best cures are rest, soup and liquids, and in a few days\
it's gone.\

What if we have a part to play in our "catching colds"?\
Not only that,\
suppose we have a part in all that happens to us?\
Suppose every time\
you made a choice, it took you in a direction leading to certain\
"experiences", including illnesses?\
What if everything you experience is "brought to you by you"?\
What\
if each choice you made led you down a path and then into contact\
with your experience?\
As a result, this lets you get a chance to choose\
again so you can go to the next "experience".\
What are the\
ramifications?\
Others may or may not be ready to contemplate such a possibility.\
But\
what if each experience was meant to show you something? What if\
you were supposed to remember something?\
Based on certain choices\
you make, what if you unknowingly create opportunities to become\
"more" aware than you are?\
III health and disease are a way through which we learn\
How can anyone learn from cancer? I recall saying to colleagues at\
lunch one afternoon, how terrible it was that a fellow co-worker\
contracted cancer.\
A headline in the local paper mentioned a new\
detection device for discovering certain cancers.\
I said to Carl, "How\
ironic that 20 years ago we hardly heard of or even knew how many\
kinds of cancers there were! Now we know that they affect us all\
differently. In fact, we can literally pick the kind of cancer we want".\
The look he gave me seemed to ask if I was out of my mind.\
I\
continued, "Now, 20 years later, by virtue of your life style, you can\
pick the cancer you want".\
He looked at the unlit cigar he was\
holding and changed the subject.\
As previously noted, there are things we do that lead to the\
experiences we have, and these experiences become lessons for our\
growth.\
Now why would anyone create sickness? They might if they\
did not know that they create all the "experiences" in their lives.\
The\
choices we make, do in fact, have more significance than we realize.\
Sickness is necessary in order to know wellness. Knowing the\
difference and understanding that we can create either, opens a whole\
new realm of possibilities.\
Let's suppose that we all agreed to help each other learn.\
In order to\
make the lessons effective, we had to forget we came here to learn.\
Therefore we plead ignorance as to the "real" meaning to life.\

Free Will and Evolution 9\
You were drawn to this book for a reason.\
Whatever the reason, you have gotten this far. For your evolution, I\
hope you choose to finish it.\
\'95 Are you truly interested in discovering who, what and why you\
are?\
Of what real value is there in understanding who you are?\
Why are you here?\
Why are things the way they are in your life?\
Why do smart people do stupid things?\
The great thing about asking any question is that the answers are\
seldom complete; they usually lead to more questions.\
Suppose we are here to evolve?\
Suppose the Creator is evolving?\
Suppose that, as part of Creator, we each are evolving as He/She is\
evolving?\
Would that help make more sense of the world as it is?\
Could that help explain why things are the way they are?\
Things are the way they are for a reason.\
Is it so we can learn and grow?\
Then what?\

Free Will and Evolution.\
9\
We mentioned the significance of polarity, duality and paradox.\
Understanding helps us define who we are and helps us make better\
choices in our lives.\
We suffer for a reason. What is this reason? To\
learn that we are responsible for what we create.\
We learn from our\
experiences in order to create better experiences.\
What kind of Creator\
would allow such decadence, murder, mayhem, depravity, avarice,\
chaos, and lovelessness in Creation?\
One perhaps, Who is learning?\
One perhaps, Who is experiencing (as we are) images of Him/Herself?\
Suppose it is necessary to experience Lovelessness in order to learn\
and better define Love?\
Creator has given each of us Free Will.\
Because Free Will is a gift, and consistent with Her intent, it is\
therefore consistent with Divine Will.\
Despite what it may look like,\
Creator has given us another gift, Love. A gift yet to be realized.\
A\
Love that cannot be comprehended only because the lessons are\
incomplete.\
Sometimes, as we seek solutions to challenges, we have to approach\
them from several directions.\
In order to grasp the answers we truly\
want, we have to really understand problems before attempting to\
solve them.\
We know what lovelessness and willessness is.\
Sometimes we have to look at what we don't want to look at, in order\
to understand better what we do want.\
If you are here to learn, evolve and become more, then\
where do you start?\
Right where you are with yourself! What else do you have to work\
with?\
You have the Creator's gift of Love, which is you. This Gift is\
like no other you have ever received.\
What is required of you by\
anyone offering you anything? Any offer, in order to be received,\
must be accepted.\
Otherwise the transaction has not been completed..\
You must accept you, at some point in time.\
You are not only made in the image of Creator, but you also possess\
the power to reason, to want, to love, and to express.\
\'95 What's suppose to happen next?\
\'95 If you have not accepted these Gifts as part of you, Love, for\
example, how can you give Love?\
How can you give what you don't have?\
How can you hold you dear and reject you at the same time?\
How can you care about something you know nothing about?\
How can you care for, misuse and abuse anything you have not\
accepted?\

Free Will and Evolution. 9\
If you do not care about you, why would\
you expect anyone else to care about you?\
If you abuse you, then it is no surprise that others might think you like\
it.\
Why should you care about you? Why not? If you have been given\
you by Creator, in Love, then to lovingly accept that Gift, might be a\
place to start.\
A place to start is to answer the question, "Who am I"?\
You are a miracle of Creation. There are more reasons to explain why\
the body should live forever, than to explain why it dies.\
The body\
regenerates itself and when free of abuse, functions beautifully.\
The\
body is complex and simple at the same time. The mind is connected\
to the body. Both are energy.\
They communicate with each other.\
Perhaps the fact that they communicate intrigues us as much as how\
they communicate, or is it more important to understand why they\
communicate?\
Are we too close to the trees to see the forest, to truly\
understand the dynamics of this special communication?\
Do you love you?\
Why? Why not? If you do, how do you love you?\
How do you\
express your love for you, or lack of love for you?\
What kind of\
choices do you make that demonstrate that love? How is your\
communication between mind and body?\
Only you can choose to love you. Only you can know what you mean\
by Love.\
When you love you, have love for you, accept the Creator's\
Gift of Love for you, only then can you give Love.\
Only then can you\
recognize and know another's Love.\

Communication\
Communication 10\
We seldom succeed at "communicating"\
To date, we as social animals have only made attempts at\
communicating. We seldom succeed at "communicating".\
The first communication we fail to make is with ourselves.\
We tell\
ourselves lies first, and expect everyone we meet to believe them.\
We\
awake in the morning, knowing full well we do not want to get up and\
go to that job we don't like.\
Yet each morning we do just that; put on a\
false smile and go out to meet the world and do what we really do not\
want to do!\
"Body" is speaking loud and clear that it does not want to do "that"\
and you force it to do "that" anyway.\
No wonder Body rebels. You\
go to a "job" you don't like, and pretend that you do, so you can get\
paid on Friday.\
After all, you have bills to pay.\
How many of us are doing exactly what we want to do with our lives?\
If we are not, why not? Probably over 70 percent of us are not doing\
what we really want as a career.\
We believe we can not make a living\
at "it" doing what we really want to do.\
Instead we pretend by\
attempting to make what we really don't want to do work.\
If you fail\
to honestly communicate with you, how can you expect others to\
communicate honestly with you? We lie.\
Everyone lies. Lying has\
become a way of life. We trick ourselves into believing the lies we tell\
ourselves first, so that we can be more convincing to others.\
Why do we do this? We really didn't know any better, - until now.\
Now that you know better, you can choose to communicate better\
with you.\
When you lie to you, that makes it easier for you to allow\
66\
\
--- PAGE 78 ---\
\
Communication 10\
others to lie to you. Why do you lie to you? You don't want to hurt\
anyone's feelings.\
You don't want to disappoint anyone. You don't\
want to be found out to be less than.\
You don't want to be perceived\
as having failed, and so you lie, knowing that sooner or later you are\
going to get caught.\
Then you make every encounter a guessing game\
as to whether or not you are being told the truth by anyone.\
Masks, a way of life\
People mask themselves and present facades. As we move through\
the day, the first lie we tell ourselves and others is when we are asked\
"How are you?"\
We automatically respond: "Fine," knowing we are\
not, or suspect that the person asking doesn't really want to know.\
Our masks and facades become a way of life. We have expectations of\
ourselves and others that no one can live up to, usually.\
We are\
generally our own worst critics. We frequently take credit for\
whatever it is, if done well, and absolutely deny it, if done not so well.\
Disappointments hover over us most of our lives. As children we do\
not want to disappoint our peers.\
As adults we do not want to\
disappoint our children, or spouses, or parents.\
We ignore the\
shortcomings of those we admire until it's just too obvious to ignore.\
We often hide disappointments and shortcomings through drug\
abuse. We must avoid conflict at all cost, unless, of course, we have\
the upper hand or power position.\
Otherwise we wait until things\
change or sway into our position of power.\
Or we just lie, first to\
ourselves, then to others, that everything is just "fine".\
When conflict means you have to back down, you plot and wait for the\
opportunity to get even.\
Heaven forbid we reveal our true feelings!\
Instead, we let our Wills be crossed in order to avoid conflict with\
parents, children, spouses, or bosses.\
We compromise, acquiesce by consensus. Rationalization and\
manipulation become the order of the day, peace at any cost, even if it\
kills.\
When we do any of these things, it is not real, and we do so with\
resentment.\
All because we begin to believe the lies we tell ourselves.\
"Conflict" is a bad word. We have not learned to deal effectively with\
conflict. Arguments often lead to violence.\
Suppressed rage leads to\
violence. Resentment leads to violence, you against you.\

Communication 10\
When you lie to you, you compromise yourself. When you allow\
others to lie to you, you compromise yourself.\
When you lie\
knowingly, what are you attempting to do?\
You are avoiding\
confrontation over an issue that you will eventually face, so you're\
only postponing the inevitable.\
The issue is bound to go away if you\
ignore it long enough or cover it with a lie, right?\
Wrong!\
Eventually, you must face you!\
You will have to give up who you are pretending to be, in order to be\
who you are.\
You have to recognize your mask for what it is; an easy\
way to avoid your acknowledgement of you.\
You have to decide one\
day to accept you for who and what you are, you must drop throw\
away your mask and facades.\
Are you afraid others will not like you?\
If you are avoiding you, disliking you, not accepting who you are,\
how can you expect others to accept or like you?\
\'95 If you are avoiding trying to truly communicate with you, how can\
you ever hope to communicate with another?\
\'95 If you are continually lying to you, how can you expect\
truthfulness from others?\
Is it possible to communicate "truth" through a mask of lies?\
What would happen if we all chose not to lie, ever? What if there was\
a way to prevent lying?\
Suppose we could just invite truth? You can.\
When you choose to be honest with you, others will too.\
In communicating with others we make "assumptions" and\
"presumptions", regardless of the topic.\
What is the difference\
between "assumptions" and "presumptions"? An assumption is\
drawing a conclusion without facts;\
a presumption is drawing a\
conclusion despite the facts.\
We usually assume that a person is as good as their word, hence we\
have expectations when transacting with them.\
When our\
expectations or assumptions turn out to be false, we then have\
conflict. At this point, communications break down.\
Depending on\
who we are communicating, we win, lose, or draw;\
it's a matter of\
who is in the power position. It is about power!\
When you do not exercise your power, or give it away, someone else\
uses it, usually against you.\
Your Will gets crossed. No one takes\
anything from you. When you do not choose, others choose for you.\
Intimidation works only when you feel powerless.\
THE W BOOK\

\
Communication 10\
Will and Power are one..\
Powerlessness or will-lessness comes from you not accepting you. If\
you feel that you are inferior, regardless of the reason, so will others.\
You must exercise your will without crossing another's, and not allow\
others to cross your Will.\
Dialogue, rhetoric, and deception passes as communication among\
individuals, hence nations.\
True communication begins with individuals. How do we\
communicate effectively? Be honest with you. Be genuine with you.\
Be authentic with you.\
Be as clear as you can with you on any issue, in\
any situation, regardless of circumstances.\
This becomes easier as you\
realize that you created it.\
What you think and feel around issues helps you make balanced\
choices for your highest good.\
We use words to communicate. Since words can leave a lot to be\
desired, understanding is challenged.\
If the object of communication\
is to be understood and we don't understand ourselves, then why are\
we surprised that we don't understand one another?\
Pause a moment and recall a conversation you've had recently, with\
someone with whom you truly wanted to make a point.\
Were you\
effective? If not, why? Did communication take place? Why? Why\
not? When did the communication break down?\
Will you try again?\

Your Obligation to...\
Your Obligation to 11\
To whom do you owe the most for the quality of your life?\
All living things are energy. All things are in motion. Atoms are in\
constant motion.\
Energy can be seen more readily around living\
things. This energy is in layers of differentiated frequencies, (which\
are visible to us through our sense of clairvoyance).\
This energy is\
called the Aura. Science confirms the existence of this energy field\
through Kirlian photography.\
Things in nature apparently follow certain laws. Not all phenomena is\
easily explained, for some things seem to defy explanation.\
Thus,\
natural order sometimes look more like chaos and disorder.\
We have\
looked at reasons it appears this way, also how we individually\
contribute to the "chaos".\
We have discussed balance in reference to imbalance, how we may\
rethink who we are, and how to live in balance.\
Now I ask, why\
would you want to be more balanced? Why should you care?\
For\
several very important reasons, as follows.\
To whom do you owe the most in regards to the quality of your life?\
Knowing how reality is created, who is most responsible for the life\
you lead?\
You owe it to yourself to be clear as to whom you owe the\
most.\
It helps to ask yourself, "Who can do the most about any situation,\
ultimately?" The answer is you!\
Therefore to whom do you have the\
greatest obligation? Again, you! And why would you be obligated to\
you?\
For one reason, Love. A very special love. The love you have\
for you.\
Who but you is going to care the most about you?\
THE W BOOK 70 THE W BOOK\
\
--- PAGE 82 ---\
\
Your Obligation to 11\
You've accepted you, and to this degree, you are obligated to choose\
for your highest and best good.\
Your daily choices are important!\
For your choices, cumulatively determine your reality. The reality you\
create can be quite sobering. Recreate your reality.\
You must take\
responsibility for your choices. The love and integrity you have for\
you, means you must make each choice count!\
You are able to love\
you with honesty and genuineness, if you choose. You take\
responsibility for your choices.\
Your obligation is to you first! Hold\
yourself accountable to you.\
You owe that to you, because you love\
and care about you.\
If you attempted to live this way, what would your reality look like?\
Our world would be more loving.\
As more of us understand that\
when we love ourselves, we can offer love to others.\
For we are\
choosing from a loving space.\
We know what the world is like now.\
How much have you contributed to its condition?\
Will you continue, or do something different?\
How much does your contribution matter to the world?\
How much does it matter to you?\
What will you do next?\
It's all a matter of CHOICE.\
And no matter what you CHOOSE,\
you get to CHOOSE again\
and again and again!\

The Rules for Being Human\
Owner's Manual for Your Life\
When you were born, you didn't come with an owner's manual.\
These guidelines make life work better.\
1. You will receive a body.\
You may like it or hate it, but it's the only thing\
you are sure to keep for the rest of this life.\
2. You will learn lessons.\
You are enrolled in a full-time informal school\
called "Life On Planet Earth".\
Every person or\
incident is the Universal Teacher.\
3. There are no mistakes, only lessons.\
Growth is a process of experimentation.\
"Failures" are as much a part of the\
process as "successes".\
4. A lesson is repeated until learned.\
It is presented to you in various forms until you\
learn\
then you can go on to the next lesson.\
5. If you don't learn easy lessons, they get harder.\
External problems are a precise reflection of\
your internal state.\
When you learn inner\
obstructions, your outside world changes.\
Pain is how the universe gets your attention.\
THE W BOOK\
72\
THE W BOOK\
\
--- PAGE 84 ---\
\
6. You will know you've learned a lesson\
when your actions change.\
Wisdom is practice.\
A little of something is\
better than a lot of nothing.\
7. "There" is no better than "here."\
When your "there" becomes a "here" you will\
simply obtain another "there" that again looks\
better than "here."\
8. Others are only a mirror of you.\
You cannot love or hate something about\
another unless it reflects something you love\
or hate about yourself.\
9. Your life is up to you.\
Life provides the canvas; you do the painting.\
Take charge of your life-or someone else will.\
10. You always get what you want.\
The Rules for Being Human 12\
Your subconscious rightfully determines what energies,\
experiences and people you attract - therefore, the only\
foolproof way to know what you want, is to see what you\
have.\
There are no victims, only students.\
11. There is no right or wrong, but there are consequences.\
Moralizing doesn't help.\
Judgments only hold\
the patterns in place. Just do your best.\
12. Your answers lie inside you.\
Children need guidance from others; as we mature;\
we trust our hearts, where the Laws of Spirit are written.\
You know more than you have heard read or been told.\
All you need to do is to look, listen and trust.\
13. You will forget all this...\
14. You can remember any time you wish...\

Body Speaks with Spirit, Heart, & Will 13\
Body Speaks\
with Spirit, Heart, I Will\
Introduction: A Dialogue Between the Four Aspect\
&A\
We have learned that there are Four Aspects of God. They are: Spirit,\
Heart, Will, and Body.\
To understand God, we need to understand\
that Spirit is electric energy, masculine in nature, and is represented\
by the 7th, 6th and 5th Chakras.\
Will is magnetic energy, feminine in\
nature. It is emotional energy and feels everything that confronts it.\
It\
is represented by the 3rd, 2nd and 1st Chakras.\
Spirit and Will are\
polarized hence, the problem is the separation of Spirit and Will.\
They\
must come together in Heart to accomplish Balance.\
Since we are all a part of God and Goddess, we too have Four Aspects:\
Spirit, Heart, Will and Body.\
This second part of the book presents a dialogue between the Four\
Aspects. Let's listen in on the dialogue.\
The figures are vaguely\
defined; they seem to have form but no shape.\
They appear to be\
humanoid but not quite. They each are distinct in color.\
As we seem to be invited into their mist, we can hear what appears to\
be a conversation, though there is no sound;\
no one seems to be\
talking...\
